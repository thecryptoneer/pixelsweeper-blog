summary: We'll be sweeping the floor on several BNB Chain NFT collections and redistributing
  those NFTs back to PixelSweeper holders.

---
PixelSweepers is a set of 10,000 ERC721 3D NFTs on BNB Chain.

#### **We'll be sweeping the floor on several BNB Chain NFT collections and redistributing those NFTs back to PixelSweeper holders.**

9,500 PixelSweepers will be available for mint at a cost of around $100 BUSD (in BNB). 500 NFTs will be reserved for marketing and the team.

The BNB raised through public mint will be allocated as follows:

* 90% used to sweep the PancakeSquad floor
* 5% of the BNB raised will be used to sweep the floor of other collections as voted on by PixelSweeper holders
* 5% of the funds will be designated for the team.

## PixelSweeper Voting

Aside from sweeping the PancakeSquad floor, PixelSweeper holders will get to vote on which other BNB Chain projects we sweep.

Eventually, PixelSweeper holders will also have an opportunity to vote on which NFTs will be purchased to be added to the primary PixelSweeper Staker & Player Pots

The first vote for PixelSweeper NFT holders will be on which other three BNB Chain collections will have their floor swept from the initial mint. This vote will take place after all Sweepers are minted:

1st Place: $25,000 Sweep

2nd Place: $15,000 Sweep

3rd Place: $10,000 Sweep

## Why Sweep so many Squaddies?

Our goal is to make PixelSweeper sustainable for all holders. The longer things are sustained, the more Sweeping we can do on all projects. We’ll initially be sweeping $50,000 worth of NFTs across three non-PancakeSquad floors, and we think this will have a very positive impact to those other collections, and to the BNB Chain NFT space.

A portion of the money from future ticket sales will also be used to sweep other floors in the future too. By having the biggest and most popular collection on BNB Chain at the center of our mechanisms we are confident that the PixelSweepers will hold some value, that tickets will be sold and hopefully in years to come our robots will be out there sweeping other collections too.

## **Distribution of Swept NFTs**

The NFTs swept will be randomly distributed to PixelSweeper holders through two “Pots” on pixelsweeper.com.

One Staker Pot and another Player Pot.

## **Staker Pot**

Each week you’ll have a chance to win one or more PancakeSquad NFTs, or an NFT from another BNB Chain collection, just by holding a PixelSweeper.

The more rare your PixelSweeper is, the higher chance you will have in the weekly distribution, so people will be incentivised to collect and hodl the rarest Sweepers too. Rarity will be based on the Rarity Score + Sets parameter from Rareboard.

That said, rarity will only give a slight advantage.

For example, having the two most common PixelSweepers will still count more than having the most rare 1 PixelSweeper

## **Player Pot**

The Player Pot will give you a second opportunity to win NFTs through weekly ticket sales. You will only be able to buy tickets for the Player Pot if you hold a PixelSweeper. Ticket sales will allow us to continue sweeping the floor indefinitely.

Tickets will cost $1 each, and you will be able to purchase a maximum of 100 tickets for every PixelSweeper that you have.

Funds from the weekly ticket sales will be allocated the same as the funds raised from the initial mint:

* 90% Sweeping Pancake Squad Floor
* 5% Sweeping the floor of other BNB Chain Collections as voted on by PixelSweeper holders
* 5% Team

Every time the 5% from ticket sales reaches $10,000, a new vote will be held for PixelSweeper holders to pick which project will be swept.
