Hello fam.

New week, new format for your "LAST WEEK‚Äôs SUMMARY" üî•

For the month of June (and perhaps, others in the future) 50% of the revenue will be used to sweep sweepers. The sweeper sweep will be redistributed to rareboard users üëÄ

Buying on rareboard costs you nothing more than buying the same NFT on another marketplace. Rareboard is a marketplace aggregator: when you make a purchase on Rareboard, it‚Äôs like rareboard buys on the marketplace for you, and sometimes earns a % of the transaction fees depending on the agreement  it has with the marketplace. It‚Äôs 50% of this revenues that is used to sweep sweepers.

But don't stop at Pixelsweeper, all Rareboard income is used for sweeping. You can also use it also to buy the nfts of your favorite collections, and mint from new ones. And since recently, you can now accept NFTkey bids on rareboard.

An additional advantage for you: Rareboard mint pass!

The more you use Rareboard, the more you increase your user score, the more chances you have of obtaining Rareboard Mint Pass. You can learn more about it here.

What is Vivatech ?

Viva Technology, or VivaTech, is an annual technology conference, dedicated to innovation and startups, held in Paris, France. VivaTech was founded in 2016 by Publicis Groupe and Groupe Les Echos, about 126,000 visitors have attended.

We were surprised to discover we were in the spotlight on the Binance booth, with some nfts from PancakeSwap too. It was an incredible moment and we are proud to have been represented and recognized by Binance.

#### **#SPOTLIGHT MEMBER OF THE WEEK:**

![](/assets/img/sans-titre-271_20220620125741.png)This week I'd like to spotlight Nitro.

Nitro is a big holder (yeah, he is a whale!) of several collections. Sweepers of course but also Pancake Squad, Shitpunk, BBB and a few others.

Nitro is still active on our telegram chat, he brings a good mood to our days and we can't stop him: Nitro buy again!

But beware, Nitro doesn't like to buy at floor price. Nitro analyzes, Nitro asks Luke for advice, then Nitro buys. If a sweeper is in Nitro's wallet, then it's a medium rare, for sure!

Thank you Nitro for your investment in the community ‚ù§Ô∏è
