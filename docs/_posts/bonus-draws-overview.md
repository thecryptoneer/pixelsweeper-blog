# **Community Vault Bonus Draws**

The BNB raised by PixelSweeper will not only be used to sweep the Pancake Squad floor. We’ll be sweeping the floor of other BNB Chain NFT collections as well, as voted on by our PixelSweeper holders.

The BNB generated through our initial mint and ongoing [Player Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/13/pixelsweeper-player-pot-overview/ "Player Pot Overview") ticket sales will be allocated as follows:

* 90% will be used to sweep the Pancake Squad floor
* 5% will be used to sweep the floor of other BNB Chain collections as voted on by PixelSweeper holders
* 5% will be designated for the team

The NFTs swept from the other BNB Chain collections will be distributed in our Bonus Draws.

## **Post Mint PixelSweeper Voting**

Aside from sweeping the PancakeSquad floor, PixelSweeper holders will get to vote on which other BNB Chain projects we sweep.

After PixelSweeper is 100% minted, PixelSweeper holders will vote on which three BNB Chain collections will have their floor swept with the 5% of the funds generated from the PixelSweeper mint. Again, this vote will take place after all Sweepers are minted, and the funds will be allocated to the three winners as follows:

1st Place: $25,000 Sweep

2nd Place: $15,000 Sweep

3rd Place: $10,000 Sweep

## **Player Pot PixelSweeper Voting**

In addition to the 3 winning collections mentioned above, we will be sweeping other collections on an ongoing basis as well, thanks to our [Player Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/13/pixelsweeper-player-pot-overview/ "Player Pot Overview") ticket sales.

Remember, you can win an NFT for free every week, simply by staking your PixelSweeper, in the [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Overview"), but you also have a secondary chance to win a Squaddie if you purchase tickets for the weekly [Player Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/13/pixelsweeper-player-pot-overview/ "Player Pot Overview"). This is how we keep the PixelSweeper mechanics sustainable long term, beyond the initial BNB raised from the mint.

5% of all BNB raised from[ Player Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/13/pixelsweeper-player-pot-overview/ "Player Pot Overview") ticket sales will be used to sweep the floor of other BNB Chain collections, which again will be voted on by PixelSweeper holders.

Every time this 5% adds up to $10,000, we will hold a vote where PixelSweeper holders can vote on which BNB Chain NFT collection will get swept.

Note: Eventually PixelSweeper holders will also have an opportunity to vote on which NFTs will be purchased to be added to the primary PixelSweeper [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Overview").

## **Distribution of other BNB Chain collection NFTs**

All of the non-Pancake Squad NFTs that are swept will be distributed to PixelSweeper holders who stake their Sweepers into the [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Overview"), through our **Bonus Draws**. That means you won’t have to buy additional [Player Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/13/pixelsweeper-player-pot-overview/ "Player Pot Overview") tickets in order to have the chance to win NFTs from these other collections.

Bonus Draws will take place regularly, however the frequency will depend on the number of NFTs that we’re able to sweep from these other collections.

In the Bonus Draws, there will be up to 5 NFTs available to win. Your chance of winning will depend on the number of PixelSweepers you have staked in the [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Overview"), with the same small adjustment for Sweeper Rarity (see the Staker Pot Overview article for details on the impact of rarity).

## **Keeping the Bonus Draws Fair**

Similar to the Pancake Squad [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Overview") Draws, there will be an adjustment for how long you are staked in the Pot in the seven days preceding the Bonus Draw. This is done in an effort to discourage people from buying Sweepers right before the draw, and then putting them back on the market right after finding out if they won or not.

There will be multiple winners in the same draw for the Bonus Draws. To keep things fair, the same staked PixelSweeper will not be able to win twice in the same draw. However, if you own and stake multiple different Sweepers from the same wallet, you will still have the chance to win more than once from the same draw, as each Sweeper will be counted differently.
