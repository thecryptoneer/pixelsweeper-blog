### How it works ?

Here is a link of a google folder : [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w4oaZ4JXt_6BCNix0XJLv3kkIWP7hSs7) , inside you will find a background and different Sweeper attributes on the Halloween theme.

‚Ä¢ **You must decorate the background and create your Scary Sweeper.**

‚Ä¢ **You can use all the files from the** [**google folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w4oaZ4JXt_6BCNix0XJLv3kkIWP7hSs7) **or create your own.**

‚Ä¢ **AI is allowed (** [**BeCrazy**](https://t.me/ElKebaboKing/) **will be happy üòÅ ) , The only condition is that it need to look like a sweeper.**

Once your artwork is finished, you need to post it in comment under our Halloween Post : [here](https://twitter.com/PixelSweeper/status/1584531078731403264?t=PiTluJCQe76oVgsbp6411g&s=19), use [@Pixelsweeper](Https://Twitter.com/PixelSweeper/) and #SWPR #NFTs #Halloween #HalloweenSWPR #BNBchain.
