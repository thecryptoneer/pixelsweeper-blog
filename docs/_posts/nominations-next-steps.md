# Nominations Next Steps

This article will provide important updates and dates specific to the Nominations and Voting for the Community Vault collections.

## Pancake Bunnies Nominations - Additional Step

Due to the complexities with the Pancake Bunnies nominations, we will be implementing an additional step for those who nominated Pancake Bunnies. Those who nominated Pancake Bunnies will have an opportunity this week to sign a new transaction, indicating which collection from Bunnies they want to nominate.

As noted in our [Voting Nominations](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/05/09/voting-nominations/) blog, the following rules apply to Pancake Bunnies:

1. The collections within Pancake Bunnies that are unlimited in number: currently Dollop, Twinkle, Churro, Sunny and Sleepy are excluded from nominations
2. Gen0 Bunnies: that is Circular, Blueberries, Drizzle, Swapsies and Sparkles will be treated as one collection, meaning you should nominate and potentially vote Gen0 Bunnies, rather than their individual names
3. Every other collection within the Pancake Bunnies will count as a collection on its own: meaning Hiccup can be nominated as a collection, Claire can be nominated as a collection etc.

Pancake Bunnies nominators will have until **Friday May 27th at 14:00 UTC** to complete this additional step, which again only applies to those who nominated Pancake Bunnies. We will announce via Twitter and Telegram once this additional step can be taken, with instructions on how to complete this step.

Nominations for any other Community Vault Collections have officially closed.

## Full Voting Power Staking Deadline & Snapshot

In order to ensure you get full voting power, you will need to have your Sweepers staked by 14:00 UTC on Monday May 30.

The voting power snapshot will be taken at 13:50 UTC on Friday June 3rd.

## Voting

Voting for Community Vault Collections will open up on **Monday June 6th at 14:00 UTC**, and will close on **Thursday June 9th**.

Whichever collection is the 1st place winner in the vote, will have its floor swept prior to our Player and Staker Pot drawings the following day on Friday June 10th. This means we’ll be able to give away NFTs from the swept collection through our Bonus Draws, as early as Friday June 10th.
