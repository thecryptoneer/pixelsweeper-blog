# **How will the Player Pot work?**

The Player Pot gives you an additional chance to win an NFT every week by buying tickets. The sale of tickets will allow PixelSweeper to continue sweeping NFT floors indefinitely.

Tickets will cost $1 each, and you will be able to purchase a maximum of 100 tickets for every PixelSweeper that you have. There is no minimum, so if you only want to buy a few tickets in one week, that is up to you.

Your PixelSweeper must be staked in order to purchase Player Pot tickets.

The more tickets that are sold each week, the more NFTs will be swept, which means more prizes are distributed and won that week. The potential exists for a maximum of $1 Million a week to be raised for new purchases.

Funds from the weekly ticket sales will be allocated the same as the funds raised from the initial mint:

* 90% Sweeping Pancake Squad Floor
* 5% Sweeping the floor of other BNB Chain Collections as voted on by PixelSweeper holders
* 5% Team

Every time the 5% from ticket sales reaches $10,000, a new vote will be held for PixelSweeper holders to pick which other BNB Chain NFT project will be swept.

## **Topping Up the Pots**

The Pancake Squad NFTs swept from ticket sale revenue will be used as prizes for the Player Pot.

So for example, if the 90% from ticket sales is enough to sweep three Pancake Squads from the floor in that week, then there will be three Pancake Squad prizes in that week’s Player Pot prize draw.

If the 90% from ticket sales is enough to sweep ten Pancake Squads from the floor in that week, then there will be ten Pancake Squad prizes in that week’s Player Pot prize draw.

Regardless of ticket sales, there will always be at least one weekly prize in the Player Pot and a separate prize in the[ Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/05/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/). For example, if there was a week where we raised 3 BNB in ticket sales which was not enough to sweep the floor, there will still be a prize for the Player Pot and a separate prize for the Staker Pot.

Any unused BNB from weekly ticket sales, such as the 3 BNB referenced above, will roll over to the following week and count toward that week’s sweeping efforts.

## **Player Pot Mechanics**

The Player Pot mechanics will work in a similar way to how Moonpot works.

If you’re not familiar with [Moonpot](http://moonpot.com), it’s a win-win savings game built by the good people at Beefy Finance. The lead dev at Beefy is on the PixelSweeper team, and we’re adapting some of the battle tested code from Moonpot and Chainlink to ensure PixelSweeper is safe and fair.

The main difference with the Player Pot, though, is that you will need to purchase tickets if you want to have a chance to win. The BNB raised will be used to purchase more NFTs, and you won’t get your BNB back after the draw.

Whoever has a winning ticket will automatically receive one of the Swept NFTs. We’ll also announce on Twitter which wallet had a winning ticket, what NFT they won, and a link to the BSCscan transaction so that you can see everything on-chain.

## **Will we really be sweeping close to $1 Million a week?**

In all likelihood, no.

However there will be an interesting game theory at play every week. Regardless of ticket sales, there will always be at least one winner of a Pancake Squad NFT from the Player Pot. The current floor for these NFTs is close to 8 BNB, or around $3200 as of the time of this article.

If only a handful of PixelSweeper holders take a chance and get $100 worth of tickets each, then the chances of those players winning is extremely high in return for the value of the NFT they might win.

On the flipside, if thousands of Sweeper holders buy tickets in the same week then more Pancake Squad prizes are going to be added to the draw. So your chances to win won’t fall dramatically simply because other Sweeper holders want to play.

## **What if I want to win without having tickets?**

We understand that some PixelSweeper holders won’t want to purchase tickets, or maybe they can’t afford to play in each week’s Player Pot. As long as you stake your Sweeper into the [Staker Pot](https://blog.pixelsweeper.com/2022/04/06/pixelsweeper-staker-pot-overview/ "Staker Pot Article"), you will have the chance to win an NFT for free.

The more people that play in the Player Pot each week, though, the longer we will be sustainably sweeping NFT floors on BNBChain.
