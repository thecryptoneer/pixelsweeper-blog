# PixelSweeper Whitelist Overview

The pre-sale for PixelSweeper starts at 14:00 UTC on Tuesday 26 April. This article will help you check how many whitelist spots you have accumulated and maximize the number of Sweepers you can purchase during the pre-sale.

There are 10,000 PixelSweepers in the collection. Each mint costs $100 in BNB, and around 4000 are available during the pre-sale period. The remaining PixelSweepers will then be available in the public sale.

There are still a few whitelist spots available, so read the full article to find out how to get yourself into the whitelist.

**At the end of the Pre-Sale Period, we will be giving away one Pancake Squad NFT to one randomly selected pre-sale minter. (Note: You do not need to stake your pre-sale Sweepers for this pre-sale Exclusive Giveaway. We will check all wallets to find the winner.)**

## Pre-Sale Period: Whitelist

The pre-sale period will last for 24 hours. It starts at 14:00 UTC on Tuesday 26 April and it will end at 14:00 UTC on Wednesday 27 April.

During the pre-sale period, whitelisted wallets (instructions below) will be able to mint at [pixelsweeper.com](https://www.pixelsweeper.com/) and [rareboard.com](https://www.rareboard.com/). If your wallet is whitelisted, you’ll be able to purchase as many NFTs as you’ve qualified for, at any time during the 24 hour pre-sale period.

Each NFT will cost $100 in BNB and you will be limited to 50 Sweepers per transaction. However, if you have more than 50 whitelist spots you’ll be able to mint more in a second transaction.

Whitelist spots are not first come, first served. Your eligible mints are guaranteed, as long as you mint them within the 24 hour pre-sale period.

At the end of the pre-sale period we will reveal which PixelSweepers you have minted. Until then, you will not know which traits your Sweepers have.

## Pre-Sale Period: Galler Launch Pad

During the Pre-Sale period - starting at 14:00 UTC on Tuesday 26 April - there will also be 250 PixelSweeper NFTs available on the [Galler.io Launchpad](https://www.galler.io/en/launchpad).

Unlike the whitelist spots, the 250 Sweepers on Galler Launchpad **will** be first come, first serve. If you want to purchase PixelSweepers during the pre-sale period and you either don’t have a Whitelist spot, or you’ve used all of yours up and still want to purchase more Sweepers, then you can purchase through [Galler.io Launchpad](https://www.galler.io/en/launchpad), but you’ll need to be quick as there’s only 250 available to purchase through Galler.

There will be a limit of 5 Sweepers per transaction on Galler Launchpad, but you can mint as many as you like by making multiple transactions.

Sweepers minted from Galler Launchpad will also be eligible for the exclusive Pancake Squad prize at the end of the pre-sale period.

## Public Sale

The Public Sale begins at 14:00 UTC on Wednesday 27 April.

You can mint PixelSweepers during the Public Sale at the following sites:

[BinanceNFT](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/)

[Pixelsweeper.com](http://pixelsweeper.com)

[rareboard.com/PixelSweeper](https://www.rareboard.com/)

There will be 1,000 PixelSweepers available to mint exclusively through Binance NFT, with the rest being available to mint on the PixelSweeper and Rareboard websites.

Public Sale mints **are** first come, first serve. There is no limit to how many PixelSweepers you can mint once the Public Sale begins. You will be limited to 50 mints per transaction on pixelsweeper.com and rareboard.com but if you want to mint more than 50 PixelSweepers, you can simply make another transaction after your first one is completed.

A few days after the public sale is opened, you will be able to stake your PixelSweeper in order to win a Pancake Squad NFT. Once the entire PixelSweeper collection is minted, we will have the first vote to see what other NFT collections we will also be sweeping on BNB Chain.

# Whitelist Spots

The accumulation of whitelist spots began earlier this year. There have been multiple ways to accumulate spots and the rest of this article will focus on the opportunities that are out there.

Many of these opportunities are still available. You may be eligible for a few spots without even realizing, so please read carefully so you don’t miss out.

## Social Whitelist Spots (Telegram Only)

Social Whitelist Spots were given out to members of the Rareboard Telegram group ([t.me/rareboard](https://t.me/rareboard)), Pancake Squad Trade Telegram group ([t.me/PancakeSquadNFT](https://t.me/PancakeSquadNFT)) and the first 500 members of the PixelSweeper Telegram group ([t.me/pixelsweeper](https://t.me/pixelsweeper)).

Only one Social Whitelist Spot is available per Telegram account, and you also need to provide your Twitter handle and be following PixelSweeper on Twitter ([twitter.com/pixelsweeper](http://twitter.com/pixelsweeper)).

In order to be eligible for a Social Whitelist Spot you needed to have been in the right group before we added the PixelSweeper Whitelist bot to those groups. However, you might have already been in the right group and not realized that you could claim a whitelist spot.

**_If you haven’t claimed your Social Whitelist Spot and you are in the Rareboard, Pancake Squad Trade or PixelSweeper Telegram group, it might be worthwhile going to those groups and checking if you have a spot._**

### How to claim your Social Whitelist Spot

Go to the Telegram group that you think you are eligible for and register your wallet for the PixelSweeper Social Whitelist.

The easiest way to do this is to go to the group (Rareboard, PancakeSquadNFT or PixelSweeper) that you think you are eligible for and type the command:

/swprwhitelist

This will show you the instructions specific to that group. If you need help checking then please visit [t.me/pixelsweeper](https://t.me/pixelsweeper) and ask for support.

If you don’t claim your Social Whitelist spot before the pre-sale, you will not benefit from this spot.

## NFT Holder Whitelist Spot (On-chain Snapshot Only)

The next group of Whitelist spots are being given to the holders of certain NFTs on BNB Chain. Below is a list of eligible NFTs.

For every eligible NFT you have in your wallet (even if it is listed as a profile picture on Pancake Swap, or listed for sale on Pancake Swap or The Bull Society) you will get one NFT Holder Whitelist Spot.

There are a few more hours before an on-chain snapshot will be taken to see who is eligible, so if you want to increase your Whitelist spots, we recommend purchasing any of the following NFTs:

[Oddblox](https://twitter.com/oddbloxNFT) - Holders of the first 512 Minted (around 25 still left to mint at [oddblox.io](http://oddblox.io))

[Bitpunks](https://twitter.com/BitpunksNFT) - All Holders

[Sweet Stacks](https://twitter.com/sweetstacksnft) - Holders of the first 500 Minted Golden Tickets

[Bull Society](https://twitter.com/TheBullSoc) - Holders of Rarity Rank: 1-250

[Lil Bulls](https://mobile.twitter.com/TheBullSoc) - Holders of Rarity Rank: 1-250

[Chimpo Dreams](https://mobile.twitter.com/ChimpoDreams) - All Holders

[Pancake Squad Noneclub](https://mobile.twitter.com/PancakeSquadNFT) - All Holders with two or more 'None' traits

[Degen Ape Club](https://mobile.twitter.com/DegenApeClub) - Holders of Rarity Ranks 1-250

[Baked Potatoes](https://mobile.twitter.com/BakedPotatoBNB) - Holders of the first 420 Minted

Rarity Ranks are based on [rareboard.com](https://www.rareboard.com/) RS rankings.

### **How to claim your NFT Holder Whitelist Spot**

You don’t have to do anything in order to claim your NFT Holder Whitelist Spots. We will be taking an on-chain snapshot at around 18:00 UTC on April 25. For every eligible NFT you will be given one NFT Holder Whitelist Spot.

After the snapshot is completed, we intend to provide you with a tool that will allow you to check how many whitelist spots you have managed to accumulate, so that you can get your BNB ready for the pre-sale mint.

You are not limited to how many NFT Holder Whitelist Spots you can accumulate and use. However, you must accumulate the eligible NFTs prior to the snapshot. After the snapshot, you will not be able to increase your NFT Holder Whitelist Spots, even if you buy more of the eligible NFTs.

## Bonus NFT Holder Opportunities (Telegram Verification)

The third and final way to get Whitelist Spots was only announced a couple of days ago. These are bonus opportunities available for holding any NFTs from the following BNB Chain collections:

* Trippy Trunkz

  [https://t.me/TrippyTrunkz](https://t.me/TrippyTrunkz)
* The Living Dead

  [https://t.me/TheLivingDeadNFT](https://t.me/TheLivingDeadNFT)
* Exo Warrior Official

  [https://t.me/Exogeneral](https://t.me/Exogeneral)
* Doodle Apes

  [https://t.me/doodleapes](https://t.me/doodleapes)
* Moon Walkers Club

  [https://t.me/themoonwalkersclubofficial](https://t.me/themoonwalkersclubofficial)
* Sluggish Sloths

  [https://t.me/SluggishSloths](https://t.me/SluggishSloths)
* Retro Boyz Association

  [https://t.me/retroboyzass](https://t.me/retroboyzass)
* Ape Heroes

  [https://t.me/ApeHeroes](https://t.me/ApeHeroes)
* Crypto Girlfriends

  [https://t.me/cryptogirlfriend](https://t.me/cryptogirlfriend)

Each of these collections have been given a maximum 100 Bonus Whitelist spots for their holders. You can claim a maximum of three bonus whitelist spots per project.

### How to claim your Bonus NFT Holder Whitelist Spots

If you hold NFTs from any of the bonus projects you will need to DM [@PixelSweeperWLBot](http://t.me/pixelsweeperWLBot) in Telegram, with the following message in the exact format that it appears below, but with your wallet address and the number of WL spots you plan to claim between 1 and 3.

Whichever number of spots you choose to claim, between 1 and 3, you must hold that many of that collection’s NFT at the time of the NFT snapshot (For example, you must hold 3 Ape Heroes to claim 3 of the 100 Ape Heroes Bonus WL spots).

Here is the message you will need to DM to the bot:

/claimWL &lt;ContractAddress&gt; &lt;UserAddress&gt; &lt;amountOfWL&gt;

Example using the Ape Hero’s Contract Address:

/claimWL 0xFc27bA34347AFccb2d386093b9671b53D2294a96 0xec8d779c61f4483Acb5Ed5Ad5Eb4a0af90e6771B 3

The deadline to register for these spots will be shortly before the pre-sale mint. In order to benefit from the Bonus NFT Holder Whitelist Spots, you must have carried out the instructions above, as well as hold the NFTs. Unlike the regular Holder Whitelist Spots, just having the Bonus NFTs in your wallet will not be enough.
