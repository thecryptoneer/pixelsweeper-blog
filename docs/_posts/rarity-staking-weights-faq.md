# Rarity & Staking Weights FAQ

This FAQ will explain how the length of time your Sweepers are staked, and the rarity of your staked Sweepers, will impact your chances of winning in the pot draws, as well as the weight your votes will carry.

**Q. Will the length of time I have my Sweepers staked impact my chances of winning or impact the weight of my votes once voting starts?**

A. Starting Monday May 16th, the length of time your Sweepers are staked, each week, will impact your chances of winning and the weight of your votes.

**Q. How will length of staking be weighted?**

A. To get the maximum time bonus, you will want to have your Sweepers staked by Mondays at 14:00 UTC.

From there, the time bonus is linear.

Stake by Monday 14:00 UTC - 100% time bonus

Stake by Tuesday 14:00 UTC - 75% time bonus

Stake by Wednesday 14:00 UTC - 50% time bonus

Stake by Thursday 14:00 UTC - 25% time bonus

Time will reset after each Fridays drawing, and will resume again the following Monday by 14:00 UTC

**Q. Will the rarity of my staked Sweepers impact my chances of winning and the weight of my votes?**

A. Yes the rarity of your staked Sweepers will impact your chances of winning and the weight of your votes.

The rarity weight formula is simple:

Rarity weight is determined by subtracting your staked Sweepers rank by 20,000

Example:

Rarity 10 Sweeper:

20,000 - 10 = Applied Weight is 19,990

Rarity 9,000 Sweeper:

20,000-9,000 = Applied weight is 11,000

**Q. Can you give an example of how this would work if one person has a really rare sweeper and another person has two very common sweepers?**

A. John has 1 Sweeper staked with rarity rank 1 and Dave has 2 Sweepers staked, rarity ranks 10,000 and 9,999,

John’s applied weight is 19,999

20,000-1 = 19,999

Dave’s applied weight is 20,001 (20,000-10,000= 10,000; 20,000-9,999 = 10,001; 10,001 + 10,000 = 20,001)

So even though John has the rarest Sweeper, Dave’s odds of winning are still slightly better by having the two most common Sweepers staked
