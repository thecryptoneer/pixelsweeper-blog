# Voting Nominations FAQ

The following is a summary of the frequently asked questions (FAQ) from our Voting Nominations blog found [here](https://aagwam0qpicu-g.instant.forestry.io/2022/05/09/voting-nominations/) 

**Q. What is the difference between nominating a project and voting for a project?**

A. Nominating a project means you are putting that project's name forward to be included on the list of projects that will be voted on by PixelSweeper holders.

Once the list of nominated projects is final, then holders will be able to vote for their favorite project.

**Q. How many PixelSweepers do we need to have staked in order to nominate a project for voting?**

A. In order to nominate a project, you must have at least 10 PixelSweepers staked by 13:50 UTC on Friday May 13, which is when the snapshot will be taken to determine who is eligible to nominate.   
  
If you stake after the draw on Friday May 13, you will not be eligible to nominate.

**Q. How many PixelSweepers do we need to have staked in order to vote for a project?**

A. In order to vote, you will need to have at least one PixelSweeper staked. The voting power snapshot will be taken at 13:50 UTC on Friday May 20th, and voting will begin on Monday May 23.

When you vote for a collection, all the Sweepers you have staked will count toward the same project.

**Q. What if I want to split my votes and vote for more than one project?**

A. If you wish to nominate or vote for more than one project, you will need to have your Sweepers split across multiple wallets.

**Q. When will the snapshot be taken to determine who has the 10 Sweepers required to nominate a project?**

A. The snapshot will take place 13:50 UTC on Friday 13 May

**Q. Are there any restrictions on which projects can be nominated?**

A. For projects to qualify for nominations, they must be NFT collections on BNBChain, and they must be available for trading on either [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/nfts/collections), [NFTKey ](https://nftkey.app/bsc)or [The Bull Society](https://www.thebullsoc.com/marketplace) marketplaces

**Q. Can projects be nominated if theyâ€™re not minted out?**

A. Yes they can, as long as minting is available via Rareboard and like the other eligible collections, it must already be tradeable on PancakeSwap, NFTKey of the Bull Society

**Q. Can we nominate PixelSweeper?**

A. The PixelSweeper collection itself is excluded from nominations. This is because we want to support the entire BNB Chain ecosystem and get as many different communities excited about what we are doing with our Sweepers

**Q. Will Sweeper rarity and the length of time my Sweepers are staked be a factor?**

A. The rarity of your Sweeper, and the length of time that you have it staked in the week preceding a vote will have the same impact on your voting power as it does on your chances to win. This means that the community members that are most invested in PixelSweeper will have the largest impact on the collections that we will sweep.

**Q. When will the nomination process and voting begin?**

A. The nomination process will begin on Monday May 16. Voting will take place on Monday May 23
